## Hi there üëã and welcome to my GitHub School, fellow Sysout.print(developer)!

### Agenda
#### Starting out
You start my making a decision to become a software engineer - and hopefully - a good software engineer. The straightforward option is to go for a formal degree. The other is to organize things yourself. In this GitHub we focus on **self-learners**. Many software engineers are self-taught. But I must tell you - it's not for everyone. You might not have the right educational background for it. You might have time and personal constraints. Your boss might not be supportive of the career switch. You might not understand things at first - or even - dislike the material. But that's just how it is. If you are serious and determined you will have to push yourself to make it through the initial stage. This can take anywhere from one to two years. Rest assured it's well worth the effort from both an intellectual and financial angle. I recommend regular physical exercise to keep yourself mentally invigorated. The more receptive your brain the faster you will learn and remember. Enough said. Let's begin!

| Book / Course / Platform | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) | Start here. the most popular online class on the net. This course is free. |
| [Building Java Programs](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/013547194X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=building+java+programs&qid=1634032853&sr=8-1) | I recommend learning Java as your first language since it's the easiest to understand and is built upon all important programming paradigms. This book provides a full overview of the language along with a plethora of exercises on each topic. |
| [Data structures & Algorithms by Princeton University - Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) | Good starting point to learn a difficult subject. It's equivalent to a 2nd year CS undergrad class. The best part are the live simulations of all major algorithms and performance discussions. This course is free. |
| [Data structures & Algorithms by Princeton University - Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) | Sequel to the one above. This course is free. |
| [Data structures & Algorithms in Java [for interview preparation]](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/0672324539/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=robert+lafore&qid=1634031320&sr=8-1) | It's one of the best books I've ever read. This book contains lucid explanations to every fundamental DSA topic and is a valuable guide for programming interviews. DSA's are the most common interview topic. |
| [Cracking the Coding Interview [for interview preparation]](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2ZU6USGS5QL17&dchild=1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1634031401&s=books&sprefix=cracking+the+%2Caps%2C304&sr=1-1) | One of the most famous books in CS and interview preparation. I recommend to focus on getting the in-chapter problems right. Solutions are given in the back. Longer explanations are available [here](https://quastor.org/cracking-the-coding-interview/arrays-and-strings/one-away). |
| [HackerRank [for interview preparation]](https://www.hackerrank.com/) | Online in-editor coding questions of 100's of problems with varying difficulty. Questions resemble real interview questions. Again, I recommend getting the easy problems right. Many companies will make you go through coding interviews for an initial assessment of your skills. |
| [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals by Duke University [certification course]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming?) | This Coursera certification is a hard undertaking, but you will learn how to write longer programs. |
| [Oracle Certified Associate [beginner-level certification]](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-associate-java-se-8-programmer/trackp_333) | Official Oracle certification. I recommend getting this certification since you will start receiving more responses in your next job search. To prepare I recommend doing [mock exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/oracle-java-associate-certification-exam-course-1z0-808/) after working through [Mala Gupta's book](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1617293253/ref=sr_1_11?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=GOM6ZN4B6653&dchild=1&keywords=oracle+certified+associate%2C+java+se+8+programmer&qid=1634220274&sprefix=oracle+cer%2Caps%2C240&sr=8-11) and the official study guide.  |
| [Spring and Spring Boot](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-spring) | Spring is the most established framework for web application development. Spring Boot is all the rage now but feel free to replace this with any other framework. |
| [Soft Skills](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B09BP6JWTQ/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=soft+skills+software&qid=1634041992&s=books&sr=1-1) | Soft skills are less important but still necessary and require constant practice to solidify. Great book which teaches all the essentials. |
| [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1593279922/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=automate+python&qid=1634041870&sr=8-1) | Two languages in your tool belt is always better than one! This book teaches Python by familiarizing you with the syntax and next, many cool short scripts for accomplishing simple tasks.|
