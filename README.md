### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my GitHub

Success isn't only based on your education or work experience. It's also wired to your emotional state and internal motivation. This GitHub aims at solving this problem by sharing crucial knowledge and increasing one's general awareness, which translates into more informed decisions and better career planning. I highly encourage reading to all engineers and determined entrepreneurs regardless of which stage of their careers they are in.
