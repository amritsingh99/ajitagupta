## Hi there 👋 and welcome to my GitHub School, fellow Sysout.print(developer)!

### Personal Growth
Personal growth is defined as a process of improving one's awareness and developing one's ideal identity. Maximizing our talents and potential. Making changes to our life and mindset that will help us achieve our most important goals and live a life that is as enjoyable and fulfilling as possible.

### Content
Hello - I am Ajita Gupta and I am about to share with you a few secrets that you can use to enhance your personal growth. Like most things in life, success is something that has to be worked for. There are many ways to go about continuing and accelerating your journey going forward. The majority of them stem from pushing your boundaries and expanding your horizons. In this GitHub we embark on a new adventure by stepping out of our comfort zones and trying new things that will hone us into a better person, more capable and open to the wisdom and lessons that other people have to offer.
### Agenda
#### Starting out
You start my making a decision to become a software engineer - and hopefully - a good one. But I must tell you - it's not for everyone. You might not have the right educational background for it. You might have time and personal constraints. Your boss might not be supportive of the career switch. You might not understand things at first - or even - dislike the material. But that's just how it is. You will have to push yourself to make it through the initial stage. Rest assured it's well worth the effort from both an intellectual and financial angle. I recommend regular physical exercise to keep yourself mentally invigorated. That's it. Now, let's begin!

| Book / Course / Platform | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) | the most popular online class on the net |
| [Building Java Programs](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/013547194X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=building+java+programs&qid=1634032853&sr=8-1) | I recommend starting with Java since it's the easiest to understand and is built upon all important programming paradigms. This book provides an interview of the language along with a wide array of exercises on each topic. |
| [Data structures & Algorithms by Princeton University - Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) | Good starting point to learn a difficult subject. It's equivalent to a 2nd year CS undergrad class. The best part are the live simulations of all major algorithms and performance discussions. |
| [Data structures & Algorithms by Princeton University - Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) | Sequel |
| [Data structures & Algorithms in Java [for interview preparation]](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/0672324539/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=robert+lafore&qid=1634031320&sr=8-1) | It's one of the best books I've ever read. It contains lucid explanations to every fundamental DSA topic and is a valuable guide for programming interviews. |
| [Cracking the Coding Interview [for interview preparation]](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2ZU6USGS5QL17&dchild=1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1634031401&s=books&sprefix=cracking+the+%2Caps%2C304&sr=1-1) | One of the most famous books in CS and interview preparation. I recommend to focus on getting the in-chapter problems right. Solutions are given in the back. Longer explanations are available [here](https://quastor.org/cracking-the-coding-interview/arrays-and-strings/one-away). |
| [HackerRank [for interview preparation]](https://www.hackerrank.com/) | Online in-editor coding of 100's of problems with varying difficulty. Again, I recommend getting the easy problems right. |
| [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals by Duke University [certification course]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming?) | This Coursera certification is a hard undertaking, but worthwhile to learn the basics by writing longer programs. |
| [Oracle Certified Associate [beginner certification]](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-associate-java-se-8-programmer/trackp_333) | Official Oracle certification. I recommend getting this one since you will start receiving more responses in your next job search. To prepare I recommend doing the [mock exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/oracle-java-associate-certification-exam-course-1z0-808/) after working through [Mala Gupta's book](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1617293253/ref=sr_1_11?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=GOM6ZN4B6653&dchild=1&keywords=oracle+certified+associate%2C+java+se+8+programmer&qid=1634220274&sprefix=oracle+cer%2Caps%2C240&sr=8-11) and the official study guide.  |
| [Spring and Spring Boot](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-spring) | Spring is the most established framework for web application development. Spring Boot is all the rage now but feel free to replace this with any other framework. |
| [Soft Skills](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B09BP6JWTQ/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=soft+skills+software&qid=1634041992&s=books&sr=1-1) | Soft skills are less important but still necessary and require constant practice to solidify. Great book which teaches all the essentials. |
| [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/1593279922/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=automate+python&qid=1634041870&sr=8-1) | Two languages in your tool belt is always better than one! |


#### Becoming a Software Professional

1. [Top 12 Software Engineering Books [for software engineers]](https://github.com/ajitagupta/softwareengineerbooks)
2. [Better Programming [Medium channel]](https://betterprogramming.pub/) (tons of software articles)


To benefit the most from these techniques, you need intense, burning desire for personal improvement. You need the ability to trust, and to persist patiently, confidently, knowing that there is a cumulative effect to all of your efforts, and that you will ultimately achieve the riches and rewards that you desire.
