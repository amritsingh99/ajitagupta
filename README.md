### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my GitHub

Personal growth is defined as a process of improving your awareness and developing your ideal identity. Maximizing your talents and potential. Making chances to your life and mindset that will help you achieve your most important goals and live a life that is as enjoyable and fulfilling as possible.

Hello - I am Ajita Gupta and I am about to share with you a few secrets that you can use to enhance your personal growth. If you wish to achieve anything worthwhile in your personal and career life you must become a worthwhile person in your own self development. Like most of things in life though, personal growth is something that has to be worked for.

Success isn't only based on your education or work experience. It's also wired to your emotional state and internal motivation. The happier and more informed you are the better decisions you will make. There is however, a distinct scarcity in this space on available and accessible resources: books, studies, blogs, workshops and video talks. This GitHub aims at filling this void by imparting on you crucial knowledge, which translates into better career planning and effective self-improvement. As they say: Work smarter, not harder!
