## Hi there 👋 and welcome to my GitHub School

### Personal Growth
Personal growth is defined as a process of improving one's awareness and developing one's ideal identity. Maximizing our talents and potential. Making changes to our life and mindset that will help us achieve our most important goals and live a life that is as enjoyable and fulfilling as possible.

### Content
Hello - I am Ajita Gupta and I am about to share with you a few secrets that you can use to enhance your personal growth. Like most things in life, success is something that has to be worked for. There are many ways to go about continuing and accelerating your journey going forward. The majority of them stem from pushing your boundaries and expanding your horizons.
